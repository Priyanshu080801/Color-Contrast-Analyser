# Color Contrast Analyzer – Browser Extension
Ensuring proper color contrast is one of the most important aspects of building accessible and user-friendly web content. Low contrast between text and background colors can make it difficult for many users, especially those with visual impairments, to read and interact with a website. To help designers, developers, and accessibility testers quickly evaluate color contrast on any webpage, this repository provides a simple yet powerful browser extension.

The Color Contrast Analyzer extension allows you to pick two colors directly from any webpage—such as text and background colors—and instantly calculates their contrast ratio. Once the contrast is determined, the extension compares the results against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which define minimum contrast ratios required for text to remain legible for a wide range of users.

The tool then provides immediate feedback on whether the chosen colors pass or fail the WCAG contrast requirements. This ensures that you can make quick design decisions and verify that your webpages meet accessibility standards without needing to leave your browser or manually calculate ratios.

Key Features

Color Picker Integration – Select two colors directly from the webpage with ease.

Automatic Contrast Calculation – Instantly computes the contrast ratio between selected colors.

WCAG Compliance Check – Evaluates results against WCAG AA and AAA standards.

Quick Feedback – Clearly indicates whether the chosen colors pass or fail accessibility guidelines.

Why Use This Tool?

Accessibility is not only a best practice but also a necessity for building inclusive web experiences. By ensuring proper contrast, you can improve readability for users with visual impairments, low vision, or color blindness, while also enhancing the overall usability of your site. This extension saves time by providing instant results, making it ideal for developers during coding, designers during prototyping, or QA testers during accessibility audits.

Whether you are fine-tuning a color palette or checking compliance on a live site, the Color Contrast Analyzer extension helps you create digital experiences that are accessible to everyone.
